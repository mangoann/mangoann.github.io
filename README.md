# About Me
Data professional with expertise in statistical modeling, large-scale data processing, and BI engineering. At Amazon, I design optimized ETL pipelines, build relational databases, develop scalable KPI dashboards using SQL, Python, and QuickSight, and apply statistical analysis to drive predictive insights that support data-informed decision-making. My work enables real-time decision-making and cross-functional insights through empirical analysis and performance optimization.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading books on science fiction, religion, and philosophy, staying current with developments in data science and finance, and spending time with my dog, Chloe.

**My superpower:** I find joy in every small moments—and I consider myself lucky in more ways than one. I bring that quiet optimism and curiosity into every aspect of life, including how I approach data, challenges, and collaboration.

**My philosophy:** Inspired by the Taoist philosophy of Wu Wei (无为) from Laozi—acting in harmony with the natural flow, I belief that truly great things are not forced into form, but take shape in their own time. This mindset guides how I grow, create, and contribute.
