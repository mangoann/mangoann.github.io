## Projects
### 1. People Analytics: Employee Churn Predictive Analytics
This project demonstrates how data tools can drive strategic HR decisions. By identifying key factors behind voluntary turnover and building a predictive model, I help HR teams flag high-risk employees early and prioritize retention efforts. The interactive Tableau dashboard turns raw HR data into actionable insights, supporting data-informed decisions that reduce churn and retain top talent.
