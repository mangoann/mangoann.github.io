## Projects
### 1. Grocery Product Analytics: Instacart Hero Products and Their Patterns
This project analyzes Instacartâ€™s product-level order data and confirms a strong Pareto effect: fewer than 10% of products drive over 80% of total orders and customer reach. To understand what sets these high-impact SKUs apart, the analysis also includes an LLM-powered semantic pattern mining system that surfaces common traits and categories shared by the top performers.

### 2. People Analytics: Employee Churn Predictive Analytics
This project demonstrates how data tools can drive strategic HR decisions. Beyond data visualization, I conducted a correlation analysis to uncover key drivers of churn, and developed a predictive model to flag at-risk employees early. This enables HR team flag high-risk employees early and prioritize retention efforts.
